# **Hosting A Server**

### **Notice: At the moment there is no way to host a dedicated server.**

---

## To host a server you must have a few things.
- A working copy of R5Reloaded.
- A stable internet connection.
- Knowledge and the ability to port forward on your router.

## 1. Port Forwarding
Go to your routers settings and add a port forwarding rule, you will need to add the range `37015-37020` using `UDP` if you have an option for both UDP and TCP, use that.<br/>
You may also want to open up your windows firewall if you're having trouble.<br/>
[Canyouseeme](https://canyouseeme.org/) can also be useful.

## 2. Starting a server
Open R5Reloaded<br/> 
If you would like to host a tdm use the command `launchplaylist custom_tdm` in the console.
Otherwise, open the server browser by presing `F10`, and change to the `Host Server` tab.<br/> Next, fill out any appropriate information; add a password if you want, and mark the `Broadcast server to server browser` box if you want this server to appear in the server browser.<br/>
You should also selct the map you would like to start the server in.<br/>
See: [Can I play new Apex maps?](../faq/faq#can-i-play-new-apex-maps)<br/>
You can now confirm your server is up and running by pressing `F10` to open the server browser, and navigating to the `Host Server` tab. You should be able to see the status of your server above the `Reload Scripts` button.


### You should now have an Apex server up and running!
